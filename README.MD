### Description:  
A simple and responsive image gallery engine / website plugin similar to Flickr's Photostream.

Most image galleries are built based solely on an image's width attribute due to how the DOM loads and renders elements. In other words, you cannot easily create an image gallery that: scales each image based on height, keeps those images inline across a row, and keeps each row the same width and inline down the page. It is easier now with the introduction of the grid system, but there are still some issues and math involved in making it work. I developed this simple to use javascript based plugin to fix that. This plugin does all the hardwork for you so you can focus on the aspects of development that matter more.

This plugin is written in javascript and is very light weight. Each row is easily customizable and the entire tilestream is responsive thanks to the new grid system in css. Unfortunately, the plugin has not been optimized for load times yet. Meaning, the images need to load first before the script can start. Luckily however, the script is so lightweight that as soon as the images are loaded, the tilestream is visable.
